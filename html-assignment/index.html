                    John Robert is a self-made <strong>CREATIVE</strong> who was born in <strong>AFRICA</strong> in an eastern country called <b>RWANDA</b>. Growing up in a foreign country<I>(MALAWI)</I> where Education for refugees is only provided until high school, he had to find ways to survive after graduating from high school. Hours turned into days, days into months without a real-life plan with his life without a job and no potential of finding one.

                THE LEADERSHIP GUY <cite>“Don’t wait for inspiration. It comes while working."</cite> (ECONOMY P,2019, p.1). Photography happened and it became a hobby that turned into business as he was just learning photography in order not to be idle at that time. Summer of 2019, his carrier was on top when he worked with The biggest bank in Malawi, N.B, Airtel Malawi, and participated in <em>WORLD YOUTH SKILS DAY PHOTO COMPETITION</em> as a finalist and opened a photo studio before getting a big chance to pursue his studies in <b>CANADA</B> where he is studying everything related to his all-time hobby.
